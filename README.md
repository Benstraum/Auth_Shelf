# REACT AUTH SHELF

Our client, Prime Digital Academy: Room 2, has asked for an app to simulate the behavior of their shelf. That is, a list of items placed on the classroom shelf. More details about each of the features are listed below in the README.md.


## CREATE DATABASE AND TABLE

Create a new database called `auth_shelf` and create a `user` table:
 user-update

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "item" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "description" VARCHAR (80) NOT NULL,
    "image_url" VARCHAR (2083),
    "user_id" INT REFERENCES "user"
);
```

## DEVELOPMENT SETUP

* Clone the repository for your group
* Run `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`
